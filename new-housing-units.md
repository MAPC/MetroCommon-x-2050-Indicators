# üèò New Housing Units

**New housing units built 2010 to 2020: 104,000, 8% over total 2010 units**

Greater Boston remains one of the most expensive housing markets in the nation for both owners and renters. One principal reason for the high cost of housing is that production of new units simply has not kept up with the growth in demand. The region‚Äôs robust economy has attracted many new residents and has led to growing income disparities \[see Economic Prosperity indicators]. If the availability of new homes and turnover of existing units is not sufficient to meet growing demand, higher income households bid up the cost of available units, as demonstrated by the proliferation of over-asking sale prices. The high cost of units may also deter individuals from forming their own households and contributes to an increase in the number of roommate households who can easily outbid low- and even moderate-income families for the few family-sized units that are available.<mark style="background-color:orange;">1</mark> &#x20;

The initial results of the 2020 Decennial Census indicate the region added 104,000 new housing units since 2010. While this seems like a lot of units, the region also added 274,000 residents over that same time period, so housing units grew slower than population (7.9% vs. 8.6%.) It‚Äôs no wonder there is intense competition for the units that do come available. Compared to the rapid suburban growth the region experienced in the 1970s, 1980s, and even some into the 1990s, housing unit development was more evenly distributed between urban and suburban municipalities in the 2010s, however it was slower than it needed to be everywhere to keep up with demand and have a chance at regulating prices. &#x20;

The production of new homes is curtailed by restrictive local regulations, high construction costs, insufficient public funding for subsidized units, concerns about the impacts of new housing on neighborhood affordability, and attitudes that perpetuate a history of exclusion and segregation. Overcoming these barriers will require multifaceted action from municipal leaders and state lawmakers. From undoing the exclusionary zoning practices of the mid-20th century to allow for denser ‚Äúmissing middle‚Äù housing types in single family districts, and actively enforcing recent legislation that requires allowances for multifamily development around transit stations, to bolstering existing funding programs and establishing new funding streams for deed-restricted Affordable Housing, MetroCommon proposes a suite of recommendations to increase housing production, with a focus on building multifamily units and units affordable to low- and moderate-income households.

The scale and urgency of this problem also means that we can‚Äôt wait until the next Census to see how the region is doing on its production goals. Municipalities can help by consistently reporting new building permits to the Census Bureau; maintaining accurate parcel and assessor records; and contributing to Massbuilds, MAPC‚Äôs collaborative inventory of development in the region.&#x20;
