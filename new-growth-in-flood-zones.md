MetroCommon acknowledges the urgency of climate change and the need to prepare for more extreme weather events. More frequent and severe flooding is one such concern. A basic step to reduce future property damage is to reduce new construction in vulnerable areas and on sites that could be used for flood storage and green infrastructure. While it is possible to build on these sites in ways that are resilient and restorative, development in a flood zone is always at higher risk, especially if climate change advances on a fast track.â€¯â€¯â€¯&#x20;

FEMA flood hazard areas are the most comprehensive available delineation of areas at risk of coastal and inland flooding. New development may still be permitted in such zones if it meets certain design requirements, and may also be eligible for federally subsidized insurance and rebuilding support in case of storm damage. MAPCâ€™s [Massbuilds](https://www.massbuilds.com/map) database indicates that over 13,000 housing units and over 15 million square feet of commercial space were built in FEMA flood zones between 2010-2020. This includes nearly 9,000 housing units and nearly 9 million square feet of commercial square footage in areas with a 1% annual chance of flooding. This statistic also includes projects in regulatory floodways and areas with a 0.2% annual chance of flooding. Future analysis using sea level rise projections will allow us to better understand how sea level rise will impact developments along the coast, but we know that as sea levels rise, projects in high-risk coastal areas will be more and more vulnerable to damage; and high-risk coastal areas will expand, encompassing more buildings and project sites.â€¯â€¯&#x20;

Included in the developments built in flood zones are some of the largest and highest-profile developments our region has seen over the past decade. Much of the Boston Seaport, redeveloped with high-density residential buildings and millions of square feet of commercial space, is in a flood zone, as are large developments in municipalities ranging from Cambridge (Alewife), Somerville (Assembly Row), and Chelsea (new regional FBI headquarters), to Lynnfield (Market Street at Lynnfield), Wellesley (Lindon Square) and Stoughton (Woodbridge Crossing). To ensure the resiliency of these and other buildings in danger of flooding, state and local officials will need to plan for resiliency, and fund the necessary retrofits of existing buildings and environments. Officials can also minimize future risk by discouraging flood-prone development using tools like zoning and permitting processes. All of this work must prioritize the safety of populations most vulnerable to the impacts of flooding, including low-income populations, communities of color, the young, the elderly, and the chronically ill. Importantly, to have the clearest insight into where flooding is most likely, we must have access to accurate flooding data from FEMA and other sources, which provide transparent methods and limitations of their data.â€¯&#x20;
