# ðŸš´â™€ Bicyclists and Pedestrians Killed by Vehicles

#### 34 fatalities in 2019, **9.6% increase since 2010, 10.5% decrease since 2018  **

In order to achieve a healthier, greener, and less-congested region, itâ€™s essential to increase the number of trips made by walking and biking. However, the lack of an extensive, connected, and safe network of bike and pedestrian infrastructure is a major barrier to increasing active transportation. The reality is that active transportation infrastructure, while it has grown throughout the region in the last decade, remains scarce and disconnected, the tools available to prioritize safety for pedestrians are rarely utilized, and many people simply donâ€™t feel safe traveling by foot or bike. MetroCommon embraces Vision Zero, a concept that seeks to eliminate pedestrian and bicyclist deaths entirely so that all residents feel comfortable biking or walking to get around. &#x20;

The region has a long way to go before we achieve Vision Zero. In 2019, a total of 34 bicyclists and pedestrians were killed in a crash involving motor vehicles in the MAPC region (83 in Massachusetts). Passenger cars were the single largest vehicle type responsible for these fatalities, with 50 deaths attributed to persons driving passenger cars. This accounts for approximately 60% of overall fatalities in the region. In 2020, a total of XY bicyclists and pedestrians killed in a motor vehicle crash in the region (68 in Massachusetts). The 2020 figures are likely lower than earlier years because of reduced travel due to the COVID-19 pandemic, however, they should be treated as provisional, as they include open cases which MassDOT will close and finalize over time. &#x20;

Statewide, we see a steady increase, from 2013, in the share of crashes involving light truck vehicles (defined as trucks or truck-based vehicles, including sport utility vehicles (SUVs), with a gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR) up to 8,500 lbs.)1,2 This closely coincides with the rise in light truck sales,3 which today outsell passenger cars nationwide. &#x20;

Reducing bicyclist and pedestrian fatalities to zero will require bold action from city, town, and state decision makers. Municipal and state budgets must prioritize capital funding for safe bike and pedestrian infrastructure; traffic calming and speed reduction interventions; and robust bike and ped planning efforts that include bike and pedestrian advocates, community leaders, residents, and local businesses. &#x20;
